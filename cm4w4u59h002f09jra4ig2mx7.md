# What is Sarufi, and why itâ€™s a game-changer?

### What is Sarufi?

[**Sarufi**](https://sarufi.io) is a conversational AI platform that enables African developers to build chatbots and conversational experiences in African languages. The platform handles the complexities of natural language processing, including intent detection, entity recognition, natural language understanding, and intent fulfilment.

Sarufi gives you ability to integrate different payment providers direct to your chatbots allowing customers to perform transaction in case needed, very important for commerce chatbots.

7. **Sarufi's rich media support in chatbots?**
    

Sarufi's rich media support allows chatbot developers to enhance the user experience by incorporating various types of media such as images, videos, documents, buttons, and menus.

### Creating Your First Intent-Based Chatbot

Intent based chatbots are the foundation of conversation AI. these chatbots work by identifying the userâ€™s intents (What they want or need) and providing an appropriate response. Letâ€™s begin by building your first intent-based chatbot with Sarufi.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">What Are Intents in a Chatbot?</div>
</div>

Intents are the goals or purposes behind a userâ€™s input. For example:

* When a user says, "Hi," their intent might be to greet the chatbot.
    
* If they ask, "What are your business hours?" their intent is to get information.
    

By defining intents and associating them with specific responses, we create a chatbot capable of understanding and interacting meaningfully with users.

### Quick Step-by-Step Guide to Building an Intent-Based Chatbot

**Step 1: Create a New Chatbot**

1. Login to your account then navigate to chatbots using the navigation menus.
    
2. Click on the â€œCreateâ€œ button.
    
3. On the menu, select intent based option, then give your chatbot a name (e.g., â€œGreenBotâ€œ) and description.
    
4. Choose industry which your chatbot belongs (e.g., â€œGeneralâ€œ).
    
5. Then finally select the language for your chatbot (e.g., â€œEnglishâ€œ) or Swahili currently they are supporting those two.
    
6. Click on the â€œCreateâ€œ button to create your chatbot. (You will be redirected to your chatbot builder dashboard). *Nice work!*

**Step 2: Defining Intents and State Flow**

When you successful create your first chatbot, four state flows and intents are automatically created for you, (greetings, thanks, bye, and cancel) they are important to know about them, their use case and importance of having them on our chatbot, but we shall explore them more as we continue to dig deep into Sarufiâ€™s potentiality.

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734655038844/e303f76e-a9d9-4041-b066-6fa98c1b1bd8.jpeg align="center")](http://sarufi.io/chatbots)

1. **Add a Greeting Intent**:
    

If you have already noticed that the greeting intent is already made for us you can customize it, under State flow, click on the greetings flow, then there you can customize Chatbot response when the chatbot detects that user is trying to greet or is initiating a new conversation, you can add response validations, connection to the next state flow immediately after greetings flow is done. On top there is an option written â€œintentâ€œ you can click on it and add as many words as you can that you think falls in that state flow, this will increase ability for your chat bot to have a wide area of response.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1734656365225/994c0c16-d327-4a91-b39c-9b1105c29807.jpeg align="center")

2. **Add a Help Intent**:
    

After understanding how that works, now lets add a new state flow and its associated intents.

* State Name: **Help**
    
* User Inputs Examples:
    
    * "Can you assist me?"
        
    * "I need help."
        
    * "What can you do?"
        
* Chatbot Response:
    
    * "Iâ€™m here to assist you with your queries. Please let me know what you need."
        

Knowing our goal, then lets dive in:

* On the intents tab (where all states are listed), click on the plus button located top-right side of the table, this will open new state flow (empty) where we are required to fill information about our help flow.
    
* Now add the **state name** as **â€œhelpâ€œ** (lowercase)
    
* Let it be a text component do not change that, we will explore more components later.
    
* Let the message variation switch off, we will explore these features later.
    
* Now on the message field add this **"Iâ€™m here to assist you with your queries. Please let me know what you need."**
    
* Then click **â€œSaveâ€œ**
    
* Navigate to the **â€œIntentsâ€œ** tab, then click create
    
* Add the following one by one **\[ Can you assist me?, I need help, What can you do?\]**
    
* Then click **â€œSaveâ€œ**
    

There we go, we have accomplished our goal, we have created a state flow which is called help, we have added some intents **\[ Can you assist me?, I need help, What can you do?\],** so when user tries to enter one of the intents the chatbot will directly respond using the response message we have set **"Iâ€™m here to assist you with your queries. Please let me know what you need."**

3. **Test Your Chatbot:**
    

To test our chatbot, click on the chatbot preview bubble on the bottom-right of your computer screen. the chatbot we are making will show up. you will see this message **â€œSend a message to initiate conversation i.e. "Hello"â€œ,** so try sending hello, we get a multimedia response with a text response under it saying **â€œHello there. How can I assist you today?â€œ** (This is the greeting response from the chatbot). Now lets test the help state flow, go on send one of these **\[ Can you assist me?, I need help, What can you do?\],** we will get our response as **â€œIâ€™m here to assist you with your queries. Please let me know what you need.â€œ** which is the response that we have set previous.

### **Congratulations!**
